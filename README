# Photos Server

Serves photos from the
[Apple Photos](https://apps.apple.com/app/photos/id1584215428)
application locally on your Mac.

## Usage

Apple Photos might have to be open for this to work.

Make a HTTP request to `http://localhost:8363/PHOTO`...

- If `PHOTO` is a valid photo ID in Apple Photos, that photo will be
  returned.
- Otherwise, `PHOTO` will be searched for in Apple Photos and a random
  result will be returned. Results will be limited to JPEG and HEIC
  files (no movies).
- If nothing is found, a _404_ error will be returned along with a
  placeholder image.

## Implementation

A bash script that listens to a local TCP port with `nc` for a request.
It uses Javascript-for-Automation (JXA) to instruct Apple Photos to
export the requested photo to a temporary directory from which is then
served.

This will export the modified version of the photo, and convert it from
HEIC to JPEG if required. The conversion settings used by Apple Photos
are undocumented.

## To Do

- [ ] Return a random photo if one is not specified [#feature](#)
- [ ] Make sure hidden photos are never served, or only when the Hidden
      photo album is visible [#feature](#)
- [ ] Rewrite everything using the [bun](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun)
      javascript runtime. #implementation [#implementation](#)
- [ ] Confirm `8363` is an appropriate port to be listening on.
      [#implementation](#)
- [ ] Write an accompanying script that will put a markdown link on the
      clipboard that addresses the selected photo in Apple Photos.
