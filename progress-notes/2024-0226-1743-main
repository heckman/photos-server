# 2024-02-26 17:43:37 Progress Note

I've adopted the `sh/tcpserver/micro` branch as main.

I'm attracted to the versions that encapsulate all the functions into
one file, because it would be easier to distribute, but distribution is
not my goal, as this is a project for my own use.

Having the code split into three files makes it easier to code. I might
consider even extracting the svg code into separate files.

I seem to be falling into the trap of pre-mature optimization.

On that note, I've been writing all of my shell scripts in POSIX shell,
for portability, I suppose, but this whole project is specifically for
MacOS, so I might as well use the BASH shell included with that; on my
system /bin/bash is version 3.2.57. But since I'm requiring commands to
be installed via homebrew, I could easily require a newer version of
bash.

Actually, I've been writing for `dash`. I'm not going to change that
now, but if I feel like using bashisms in the future I won't hesitate to
change that.
