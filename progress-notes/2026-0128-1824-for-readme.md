# 2026-0128-1824 For Readme

Next up: update the very out-of-date readme.

Things to remember to mention:

- dependency: `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`
  we will be getting rid of that soon enough,
  probably by rewriting the http-handler in zsh
  or python, or maybe even jxa.

- when Photos Server is the default browser,
  and its control panel is open, opening any
  link will activate the control panel, and
  the link will not open in either Photos or
  the preferred browser.

- The `copy-markdown-links` executable can
  is jxa, so it can be copied to be used
  somewhere else.

- If you stop the server, it will restart on
  the next reboot.

- There is currently no way to disable or
  uninstall it. For the time being, I'll give
  instructions on how to remove it manually.
  In the future we'll make it self-removing
  by having it call a script outside of the
  application bundle that cleans up it the
  application bundle has been removed. Perhaps
  we'll also add a way to disable it, or
  having it disabled when it's stopped.
